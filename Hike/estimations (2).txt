PBi/User story/Functional points-will be estimated

for writting test cases-2hrs
validating/Review Test cases-1hrs
Test execution-2hrs


suppose: total 10 pbis for each pbi it may take 5hrs = 50hrs


Total working days in sprint 10 days * 7 hrs/perday = 70hrs each resources

workings days of resource is  8days * 7= 56


actual estimate= total hrs( resousrce)- estimated hrs for functinalities

based on this will decide how many story points will be commiting for sprint


---------------------------------------------


Regression Sprint estimates

1000

perday 40

1000/40=25days ( 25*7=175hrs)

No sprint day is 10days( 10 *7hr) = 70hrs so based on this will commit no Tcs can be executed

so 10* 40 TCs = 400 Tcs per 1 resource

like wise if 2 resource 800 tcs

3 resouce-1200

before day of sprint day starts- grooming session+Poker planing
